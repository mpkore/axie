- Payments are at the 15th and 30th of the month;
- Except the first payment, that's only after you earn 3.000 SLP;
  - You don't need to reach 150 SLP during this time, so use it to learn more about the game: search online for the best strategies, watch other people play and ask the manager for advice.
